# OpenGroundNews Documentation

This folder is the technical source-of-truth guide for the current codebase.

## Start Here

- New to the repo: read `../README.md`, then `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Building against APIs: read `API.md`
- Running ingestion and operations: read `OPERATIONS.md`
- Tuning Browser Use rotation/retries: read `ROTATION_STRATEGIES.md`
- Working on UI/theme/styles: read `GROUND_NEWS_CSS_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`

## Core Documents

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - Runtime composition
  - Data model boundaries
  - Request/data flow diagrams
  - Caching, reliability, and security design

- `API.md`
  - Full route map for `app/api/*` and `app/api/v1/*`
  - Auth gates and validation rules
  - Side effects, status semantics, and integration dependencies

- `OPERATIONS.md`
  - Local/prod runbooks
  - Environment setup and scheduler guidance
  - Health checks, troubleshooting, and incident playbooks

- `ROTATION_STRATEGIES.md`
  - Browser Use profile/proxy rotation modes
  - Candidate resolution order
  - Retry behavior and practical presets

- `GROUND_NEWS_CSS_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
  - Theme/tokens/typography/surface model used by the app

## Parity Artifacts

`docs/parity/` contains generated and tracking artifacts for parity workflows:
- `EXCEPTIONS.md`
- `PARITY_TODO.md`
- checklist/json artifacts generated by scripts under `scripts/parity/`

Treat these as outputs/trackers, not foundational architecture docs.

## Suggested Reading Order

1. `../README.md`
2. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `API.md`
4. `OPERATIONS.md`
5. `ROTATION_STRATEGIES.md`
6. `GROUND_NEWS_CSS_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`

## Documentation Contract

When docs and code disagree, code wins.

If behavior/contracts change, update docs in the same change set:
- public route behavior
- auth/authorization gates
- required environment variables
- script flags and operational procedures
