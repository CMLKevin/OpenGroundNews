# Parity Exceptions

OpenGroundNews tracks Ground News-inspired parity targets, but not every element is expected to match 1:1.

## Approved Exception: Proprietary Typeface Stack

- Ground News uses proprietary/self-hosted font assets that are not redistributed in this repository.
- OpenGroundNews intentionally uses the project type system defined in `app/layout.tsx` and CSS tokens:
  - Bricolage Grotesque (sans)
  - Newsreader (serif)
- Typography scale, spacing rhythm, and hierarchy are still aligned to the product's parity goals.

## Scope Rule

Any additional parity exception should be explicitly documented here with:
- rationale
- affected modules/pages
- expected user-visible impact
