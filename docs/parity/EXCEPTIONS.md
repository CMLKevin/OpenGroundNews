# Parity Exceptions (Ground News)

This repo targets strict Ground News UX/feature parity per `audit.md` / `docs/parity/PARITY_TODO.md`, with one explicit exception agreed up front:

## A6: Font Family Mismatch
- Ground News uses proprietary/hosted fonts (e.g. “Universal Sans”) that we cannot legally redistribute.
- OpenGroundNews keeps the current typography choices (Bricolage Grotesque + Newsreader), and we match GN sizing/weights/layout as closely as practical.
