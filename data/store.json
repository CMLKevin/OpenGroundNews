        "MIAMI (AP) — Less than three years after President Joe Biden pardoned a close ally of Nicolás Maduro, the Justice Department is once again targeting the businessman, The Associated Press has learned, an investigation that could bolster the U.S. prosecution of the deposed Venezuelan leader.",
        "Federal prosecutors for months have been digging into Alex Saab’s role in an alleged bribery conspiracy involving Venezuelan government contracts to import food, according to two former law enforcement officials who spoke to AP about the ongoing probe on the condition of anonymity.",
        "Saab, 54, amassed a fortune through Venezuelan government contracts. But the Colombian-born businessman, long described by U.S. officials as Maduro’s “bag man,” fell out of favor with the country’s new leadership that took power following the U.S. ouster of the Venezuelan president last month.",
        "The Justice Department’s newfound interest in Saab is taking place against the backdrop of the Trump administration’s efforts to stabilize relations with the oil-rich nation. The investigation stems from a 2021 case the Justice Department brought against Saab’s longtime partner, Alvaro Pulido, the former law enforcement officials said. That prosecution, out of Miami, centers around the so-called CLAP program set up by Maduro to provide staples — rice, corn flour, cooking oil — to poor Venezuelans struggling to feed themselves at a time of rampant hyperinflation and a crumbling currency.",
        "The renewed scrutiny marks a reversal of fortunes for Saab, who escaped an earlier U.S. prosecution for an unrelated bribery scheme after Biden pardoned him as part of a prisoner swap for several Americans jailed in Venezuela.",
        "His whereabouts remained unknown Tuesday, days after conflicting news accounts suggested he had been detained or brought in for questioning – at least temporarily – by officials in Venezuela at the request of the Trump administration.",
        "Neither U.S. officials nor acting President Delcy Rodriguez’s government has commented. Luigi Giuliano, an Italian attorney, said he met Saab last week in the Venezuelan capital and denied he was detained but declined further comment. Saab’s U.S. attorney, Neil Schuster, also didn’t comment.",
        "Since taking over from Maduro on Jan. 3, Rodríguez has demoted Saab, firing him from her cabinet and stripping him of his role as the main conduit for foreign companies looking to invest in Venezuela."

        "Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a series of video statements pleading for the return of their mother and indicating a willingness to pay a ransom. Authorities have described Nancy Guthrie as mentally sound but with limited mobility. She takes several medications and there was concern from the start that she could die without them, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said repeatedly.",

At one point, they tilt their head down and away from a doorbell camera while approaching Guthrie's front door. The footage also shows the person holding a flashlight in their mouth and trying to cover the camera with a gloved hand and part of a plant ripped from the yard.",

        "On Monday evening the president said on Truth Social he’d prevent the Gordie Howe International Bridge from opening until Canada “fully compensated” the U.S., and said the U.S. should own 50 per cent of the asset.",

        "Construction of the $6.4 billion (US$4.7 billion) Gordie Howe bridge was paid for entirely by Canada. It’s largely complete and was due to open soon. In a deal agreed over a decade ago, Canada is set to receive toll revenues until it has recouped the construction cost, after which time that money will be split equally between Canada and Michigan. Both governments will co-own the asset. Both governments also appoint an equal number of members to an oversight body.",
        "But the Morouns have long lobbied against Canada building a new bridge, which would rival their privately-held span.",
        "In 2012, Matthew’s father Matty Moroun supported an unsuccessful statewide ballot in Michigan in an attempt to restrict the state’s ability to own or develop new international bridges. Matthew Moroun then lobbied Trump during his first term to rescind a waiver granted by President Barack Obama exempting the crossing from having to use only U.S. steel. Matty Moroun died in 2020. Moroun companies have also filed lawsuits which would have obstructed the construction of the Gordie Howe bridge.",
        "The president wants to strike a deal with the Canadians over the Gordie Howe bridge, one of the people said. He spoke to Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday morning, who said Trump asked to involve his ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, who is from Michigan.",
        "Trump’s broadside against Canada, the largest buyer of U.S. exports, is the latest in a crescendo of tensions between the two countries as they prepare to review the economically critical U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement trade deal, which Trump negotiated in his first term."

      "paragraphs": [
        "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources told CNN.",
        "Two people familiar with the matter said later Wednesday that Customs and Border Protection, not the US military, was in control of the laser technology when it was used this week around El Paso to shoot down balloons.",
        "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed off on loaning CBP the technology in recent weeks, one of the sources said.",
        "The sources said the Defense Department led the development of the technology, but CBP was physically operating it this week. Another source familiar with the matter said Defense personnel were present when the device was used.",
        "CNN has asked the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.",
        "A source told CNN earlier Wednesday that the US military used the laser technology to shoot down four mylar balloons this week, contributing to the decision by the FAA to shut down local airspace.",
        "Those accounts come as the Trump administration has claimed that a Mexican cartel drone crossing into US airspace is what triggered the 10-mile restriction centered on El Paso International Airport.",
        "Late Tuesday, the FAA abruptly issued a temporary flight restriction that immediately grounded all flights up to 18,000 feet around the city for 10 days, effectively shutting down El Paso International Airport.",
        "Roughly eight hours later, the restriction was lifted. By the time the FAA had lifted the flight restrictions, airlines had already issued travel waivers and notified customers of potential changes.",
        "Multiple sources from the federal government and US airlines told CNN that military activity near El Paso, including US drones monitoring cartel operations and the Pentagon’s planned use of a high-energy laser designed to counter drones, raised immediate concerns for civilian traffic arriving and departing El Paso International Airport. Fort Bliss and its airfield, Biggs Army Airfield, sit just north of the commercial airport, which serves about 100 flights each day.",
        "FAA and Pentagon officials had been scheduled to meet February 20 to review potential impacts and mitigation measures for a test of the laser system, a technology the Pentagon has been testing in more remote areas of the country, multiple sources said. But the Defense Department sought to use the system sooner around El Paso, prompting the FAA to impose the temporary flight restriction until that coordination could occur. The 10-day restriction would have expired on February 21, one day after DoD and the FAA were set to meet.",
        "The FAA’s decision to close the airspace was made without telling the White House first, according to people familiar with the matter. The issue became a topic of intense focus inside the West Wing in the early morning hours of Wednesday, as Texas lawmakers pressed for answers on why the airspace was suddenly closed without first alerting them.",
        "An administration official said Wednesday morning that the shutdown was triggered by Defense Department “action to disable” cartel drones. It’s unclear if the presence of drones might have led to the acceleration of the deployment of the laser system.",
        "CNN reached out to the FAA and White House for comment about the differing explanations. The Pentagon on Wednesday continued to refer to the administration official’s statement about a drone breach having caused the airspace closure."
